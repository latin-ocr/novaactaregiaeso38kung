On parfial dfferential equalions of the form (12), where the
coiffz'cz'enls U and llee rzquct member V are fimclions of ,τ and ps only
or eonstsmts.

We shall here prove some properties of these equations, which have
a remarkable affinity with those theorems‚ that hold for ordinary linear dif-
ferential equations of the η”’ order.

Theorem I.

If u be aalys particular solution of (12), then its yeneral solution will
be obtained by addiny to u the yeneral solution of (12), provided its second
member he = O.

For putting ε = u-}-{‚ whence :flam- = usn-2„- —†- ζη-ῌ, the
equation (12) becomes

because u -is a solution of (12), therefore ζ must satisfy the differential-
