of f (ξ) and applying Taylors theoren] on F( ) , we get

Now dividing by lc and then putting lc = Ο, the general solution of
the given equation becomes

Em. 4. Before explaining the general theory of non-linear partial
differential equations of the na, order. we will by a simple example shew,
how the foregoing theory may be used to integrate such equations. Sup-

pose we have
ἔμω ³⁴·.1 Ξ f¹(y)‚

f* being a given function. Differentiating partially with respect to x, we get
²20 ἴοι Ἰ- 31,ο ἷι.ι ΞΟ·

Applying to this equation, which is linear, the foregoing theory,

ψ being put for F¹.

the equation (20) gives the roots ml = Ο, 'm2 = ‘7¹:⁰, The former root re—
‘ol
produces the given equation (with an arbitrary function of y instead of f¹)

and is, therefore, of no nse3 the latter reduces the equations (21) and (23) to

dy -.- {3⁰⁷ dm = Ο alld dcl„ Ξ Ο ·

The latter of these gives εΗ, = οι, which, in connection with the
equation ds Ξ 21„ ἅψ- ἧ- ιο] dy (or, in this case, ds: 2:1'0 dm), gives
z = “hro cc -1- β

as a complete first integral. This, in connection with the given equation,

gives ,χο = ἢῆ, ³0³ = ἔζβ j⁴(3()3

and, as these values are obtained from two distinct first integrals of the
same partial diff. equ. of the second order, they will render the equation
d: ἶ ²10 dm ÷ σοι dy integrable. Thus we get
