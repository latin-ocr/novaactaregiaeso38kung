In the first case we have for n ἢ 2ν- 1 a system of ?Q1[1)

r (er—1) equations‚ containing q, φ’, (ΝΗ). There is, therefore, only
oue more equation wanted, in order to be able to eliminate the ν n:r(2r-1)
tunetions (p, φ’, ..., ι[ι(”’”. This desired equation will in general be obtai-
ned by eliminating the r funetions ‹J(’¹) between r -}-1 of the vn-†-1:2r equa-
tions, which involve (ΙΨ) . We see, that there are several ways to construet
this equation, wherefore also we may get more than one differential equa-
tion from the given primitive. The equation required will be of the form

κ (Λ, ‘sm ‘s-22 (fr, (Η, qs, ‘11,··-¹t(1'¹‘¹³‚ ‘sss-”⁷ ‹sf.⁷¹-¹³):O..(f)‚

where J is a determinant, which is linear with respect to the differential
eoefficients of ε of the Μ’ order. Now eliminating φ, ψ, ‹pm-¹> be-
tween (f) and the before obtained equations‚ we get an equation of the form

where ,Μ —- ‹lffdff'
Thus we see, that, when the differential equation is of the (2r—1)⁸‘
order, it also becomes linear with respect to the differential eoeffieients of z
of the (2r—])⁸‘ order. We may, moreover, get more than one such diff.
equ. from a single primitive.

 

Secondly suppose τῖεν. Then we have (vids-1) equations involving
‹11²¹‚ qs, ..., ‹sn'l As these functions oeeur in a linear form⁷ elimination
between them ordinarely leads to a single equation, which is linear with
respect to the differentia] eoet'tieients ot¹ ,ε of the nst order, that is: involves
a linear funetion Δ of these quantities. This equation, then, will be of the
t'or1n(f)7 where n is to be put t'or r or vice versa. Now elimination
between this equation and the equations involving φ, (χ’, ,ιβ’-1) must
remove all these functions aud give a single differential equation of the ‘2¹¹'
order7 which is linear in the differential eoeffieients of ε of the ost* order.

There is also another mode of genesis of a partial differential equa-

tion from a primitive. Suppose
ε :f(m‚ y, (11, 02, ‹1,.). . . . . . (h),
al , α.2 , m. being r arbitrary eonstants, Such an equation Lagrange has

termed a complete pri1nitive.' Thence we get by differentiation {EQ-›QLQ
