DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE 22²⁴ ORDER. 37

together with what (61) becomes on, when n is put = 2. Here m and
μ are the two roots of the equation
ζὲῃυνηῗ-ζινινηψζυῑ2 = O ...... (67);

and, as either of these roots may be used as the value of m, the other
being that of μ, there will be two auxiliary systems. Now one integral of
each of these systems together with the given equation will in general give
the valucs of εΗ, zm and εὼς), and these valucs are then to be sub-
stituted in

after the integration of which we get expressions for zm, and :0,1‚ that
render the equation d: = :1¹0 cla· -Ι- ³0, 1 (ly integrable. This it is easy
to see⁷ because, independently cf the values of a and β, we get, when
the roots of (59) arc all uncqual‚ (η -ι- 1) distinct first integrals of the
linear equation (55)⁷ that render the equations (61) integrable⁷ and among
these first integrals there will be one (belonging to the root m = Ξ),
which is a relation involving (54) as a special case, viz

A being an arbitrary constant. Putting then A = O, the operation
is restricted to the investigation of a (complete) primitive of the given equa-
tion (54), instead of solving the more general problem to seek a primitive
of (55). The arbitrary quantities οι ancl β may⁷ of course, be determined
in the manner before mentioned.

If (64) be linear with respect to the differential coefficients of ε of
the second order, we may from (61) and (65) get an auxiliary system,
that does not involve these differentia] coefficients, because {2 Ο, ζΙ l and
ζο1 2 are then independent of them. Thus if (454) be ¹ ³ ’

where ν = 22¹0, s = 21¹1, t = :0,2, (67) becomes

whence m -f— Ξ Ξ, mlv„ = {-

Now putting sm, = p, 20¹1 = q, we have
