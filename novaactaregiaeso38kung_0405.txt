DIFFERENTIAL EQUArmNS or THE nst' ORDER. ,7

equations involving ε and its partial differentia] eoeffieients up to the n'* or-
der. n being the order of the differentia] equation, arising from the elimi-
nation of the arbim-ary constants, we must determine it from the conditions

differential equation, this also agrees with Lagiange’s view, for he supposes
¹ r = 2 when n = 1.

Finally, as our resonrees for the integration of given partial diffe-
rential equations by obtaining their gyeneral solutions are restricted, we so-
metimes get solutions involving both arbitrary functions and arbitrary con-
stants; such solutions we will term milred. Supposing

a mixed primitive, then in general the order η of the resulting differentia]
equation will be determined from the eonditions

We consider in the same way the mixed solution as particular, when

the condition
