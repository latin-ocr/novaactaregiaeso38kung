Substituting these expressions in the transformed auxiliary equation,
it becomes (ἴω = Ο , whenee ω z lc, that is
sm, -1- 216311 -1- Ῐεῗεψζ, = O.
The former of 1116 auxiliary 611113110115 now gives
y — 111Ί Ξ αι.

Now by pntting lc Σίρι) 31111 eliminating lc and οι, we might obtain
the general first integral. It will, however, be impossible to integrate,
and, therefore, we must instead of the general first integral nse the eom-
plete 0116, Therefore, supposing ιγ’(οι) to be 311 arbitrary constant lc, the
complete first integral to be integrated becomes

by 1116 integration of whieh we get εΗ, -1- lc:0>1 = ῲζῃ — lew), and by 3

Em. 3. To exemplify the method 0111111115, 11131 may be used, when
(20) has 6111131 10015, we take 1116 simple 61111311011 [ὶὲεψμψ 2‚e÷3s:„1†3s²sl‚v2 Ξ Ο,

Monge. We here integrate 1116 more general equation

&²2⁴2 0 -1- 3’(21Η-Ιι·) :11 -1- 3J(]s†k) :0 2 = Ο,
from whieh the given 61111311011 will be obtained by pntting kzo.
The equatien (20) gives for the latter equation the roots 1111 =

Now eliminating Cro and ³01 between these 611113110115 31111

we get
