32 M, FALK, ΟΝ THE INTEGRATION or PARTIAL

Em. I. :2¹0 —-—- 4:0,2 = affy.
Differentiating this equ. three times with respect to x, we get
:¹3¹0 -— 47:35, Ξ Ο,
the general solution of which is

ἔ = (My) -1- ωΦιΘ) ÷ ffQQJ) -ἱ- ψΘ--ΖὌ -Ι- ssl(y†2oe).

As the two last terms by the theorems Ι and III also belong to

the general solution of the given equation, it is only the functions φ, φ1
and <02 that have to be determined by the condition, that the given equa-
tion must be satisfied. This condition will be fulfilled, if

vm) - 2<0¹¹(²J) = O, <01⁴¹(31) = 0, 4<02¹‘(y) = -y3
we may, therefore, put

QQJ) = — {L} ‚ my) ε O and φφ) = — ,ᾗῇ-Ο ,

Hence the general solution of the given equation will be

3955 — {2213 ΔΓ vac—zv) ψ Momm)-

If the given equation had been differentiated twice with respect to
y, it would have given
κω - 4:²04 = O.
Now putting εΗ = ε’, we get
εἶθ —- 43(ζᾶ = O,
the solution of which is
= <osy-222) ΔΓ doma-r>
ΟΥ 202 = <DQ—23³) ”i- ψ (ΊΓΡᾸἘ),
and, if this last be integrated twice with respect to y, it gives
z = χω) ΔΓ 3061 (2²) -Ι- <My-‘2⁴10 4- ψιίνήὲῗιϊ).

Detcrmining here χ and χ1 by substitution in the given equation,
its general solution becomes

z = 1—,s ψ <no—210) 4- emma),

which is somewhat silnpler than that before given.
