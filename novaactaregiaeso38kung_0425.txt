DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE η”ι ORDER. ‚27

leeorem II.

[f α’, 26²), . . . ‚ um> be solutions of (42), their sum will also be a
solution of the same equation.

⁷⁴:71 r=n
For putting ε = S um, whence cmii„ = S ²1sssL2·‚2·‚ we
rzl r=1

get by substitution in (42)

sss υ,- Μ = 0,

an equation, that is identically satisfied, as every sum within the brac-
kets is Ο.

In the following we suppose the co'efficients U to be constants and,
for the sake of distinctncss, we put C in their plaees3 thus (12) becomes

S Q— :H-f', = V.
We will, however, previously treat the simpler equation
S ct¹ :ql-f, = o ........ (43).

The auxiliary equation (20) becomes here

S (-1)2⁴ Q. mn* ·= o ...... (44)
120

and has constant roots, which we represent by m„ 7722, ..., m„.

Theorem III.
If mr be any root of (44), z Ξ φ (y—m‚.x) is a solution qfffiffl).

For let ε = φ (y — wrm) , whence we have „wi-1<
= (— 1)⁷¹-¹‘ any-¹⁴ φ(”) (y — mroe) , which, when multiplied by (— 1)-'²
= (— 1)²²*-⁷²‚ reduces the left member of (43) tc

<000 <y — m> S <— ιγ· α

that is to O, as m⁷⁸ is a root os (44), and therefore the sum vanishes.
