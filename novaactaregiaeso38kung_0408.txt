When i: ⁷· the corresponding terms in (ti) vanish3 in order to ex-
clude sueh terms7 we must transform the expression (6). To this end we
use the identity

i=n=

Sor} = ἓξ ÷ §Sl . . ..... (8),

whenee the vanishing terms are already removed.

The first term in the right member of this identity undergoes no
change, when we interehange r and ῖς thus this term becomes

7⁴:11-1{:1·-1
r r1 r! Z

This double sum may be regarded as extended over the surfaee of a
rightangled triangel3 and if we sum over the same surfaee in reverse
order, it will be seen7 that the expression (9) becomes

Thus the expression ((ὶ) becomes

Now as the equation (7) is to be linear with respect to the differen-
tial eoeffieients of 2 of the n⁶¹¹ order, we must have

The last equations also may be written

where we have suecessively to put r: 1, 2, 3, (n—l); also, of
course, it is supposed7 that neither ΖΗ,0 nor 70:71³, vanishes.

Now the differential equation (7) will become

supposing the following notatione used, viz.:
