DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE πω ORDER.

Differentiating (c) with respect to w, we get

x, as far as they involve ιυ both explicitely and implicitely.

means of (b), this equation will take the form

and if between (c), (d) and the given primitive rs and ψ be eliminated,
we shall get

Thus we have the following remarkable result, viz: that the primitive
Ζ = F(‹[=‚1l')‚ φ and ψ being defined as above, gives always rise to a dif-
ferentia] equation, which is linear with respect to its highest par-tial diffe-
rential coeffioients of z, whether this diff. equ. be of the second or third
order. When the differential equation is of the second order, it will, of
course, be the equ, (a)7 cleared of φ and ψ.

Another remarkable circumstance, when the diff. equ. is of the third
order, is, that we may get more thau one diff. equ. from the same primi-
tive Ζ = F(<p‚ ψ). This is easy to see, because we might have differentia-
ted (c) with respect to y instead of to Υ, whence we should have obtai-
ned in the place of (e) a diff. equ. of the form

where, as in ex. 3, every one of the functions ‹J- contains only >one of
the definite functions u of Υ aud y. We will here examine two cases,
viZ. 1³²⁹ when the differential equation is of the (⁴27·—1)·‘l and ΞΜ] when it
is of the νώ order.
