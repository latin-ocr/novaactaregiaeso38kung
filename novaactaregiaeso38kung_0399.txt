We will examine the differential equation arising from

F(<P1‚Q2‚--<p,-‚d'‚y‚: ΞΟ ...... (1),
where F is a definite functiou and Q, Q. φ,, arbitrary functions re-
spectively of 211 ‚ πὶ, ..., vr7 whieh also are definite functione of cc, y, 2²3

thus e = e (m), φ2 = φ2 (212) etc-

If equ. (1) be differentiated partially with respect to m and y, we
obtain two equations containing the partial differential eoe'ffieients of z of the
first order together with the first derived functione of Q, Q, φτ.
Differentiating again, we get three equations with the three partial differen-
tial eoeffieients of ε of the second order and the second derived functione
of φ1 , ..., Q, and so on. Proeeeding thus⁷ we get a system of equa-
tions, finishing with those, which eontain the partial differential eoe‘ffieients
of ε of the 22⁰³ order and the πω derived functione of <pl , <02 .. Q, oz being
any whole number. These, joined with (1), are 1 -ἱ- 2 -Ι- .. -1- (n†l)=
§‘'²†l{)(²Q-ffl equations, containing the r arbitrary functione φ and their η
