2 Μ, FALK, ΟΝ THE INTEGRATION or· I’ARTIAL

The least value, we ean in ordinary cases give to n, is therefore
vz=2r—1.

Thus

A primitive (I), containing] r arbitram] fzmctions (ψ’ tlte finnt, conside-
red above, will μυᾶν-(1113] yive risa to a partial differentia equation, of the
(2r-1 )⁸t order. ¹

But in special cases (1) may give a differential equation of an order
lower than the (2ν-1)·“; for instance, when the equations, where the highest
differential coefficients of ε are those of the ΥΠ* order, do 1101 001113111 1110
funetions φ , φ’ , . . . (pff-¹), but only (0101, φρ, , . . (pff). These equations are
(r-t—l) in number and will 111 general give by elimination of the functions
<Dm a partia] differential equation of the Μ’ order. If now ν be ζ 2, 72
will be > νς because n —r τ. r— 1 . If r z 1 , then η z 1 , and the
special will coincide with the general case.

Without further reasoning we eall (1) the fleam-<cl solution or primi-
tive to the differential equation, if (1) contains r arbitrary functions, the
order of the differentia] equation being r, that is: if η = r. This will, in
fact, agree with the statement of Lagrange respecting partia] differential
equations of the first and second order. It may be observed, that for 2:⁶2

the special case 22:¹3 (in the general one, 'n Ξ 3) coincides with the state-
ment just cited,

Some examples will throw light on the above theory. We will, how-
ever, first make a few remarks as to some points 111 11, Α solution of a
partial differential equation ouylzst to be called general, when it contains as
many distinct arbitrary functions, as possible, and satisfies the differential
equation. Now it may perhaps happen, that a given partial differential
equation of the „m order cannot be satisfied by (1113] relation containing
ω, , y ‚ ε and r distinct arbitrary functions3 the solution which in this case
would be called general, is then according to the definition above given,
not really so. Thus there may perhaps be partial differential equations,
deprived of any general solution 111 the usual sense of this term. — As to
the form of (1), it is not the most general possible, because each of the
functions φ contains only one definite function v, although it might have
contained any number of such funetions3 it is, still, enough for our purpose,
because, as will bc seen afterwards, 111 11115 1110111011· we only obtain general
solutions of the form (1).
