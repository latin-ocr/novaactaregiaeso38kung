Now taking out the values of εΗ and ς] 1 and substituting in
ἀει 0 = :2 0ch -1- z 1dy, this equation will become integrable, if these
values be taken the one foi the uppei and the other foi the lower sign of
the suld.Tl]elef01e these values will satisfy the equations

Ay ——LsL1 = ss VZAUffv-l— γ
and
L³2.o= ssVzU.y-{-3.

Now multiplying these equations by — dy and dx respectively
and adding we get

φ being an arbitrary function. That this mixed solution is particular, is
shewn by ξ 1.

We do not suppose, that we have here overcome all the difficulties,
which exist in the delicate problem of obtaining a theory of partial (liffe-
rential equations of the form treated in this memoir. As to our method of
deduction, it is essentially the same as that, which Boole in his sl‘reatise
οη dgfferential equations applies to Monge's linear partial differential equa-
tion of the second order:

Ro· ÷Ss÷ Tc=1z

We hope in a future memoir to extend the theory, now given, to
any number of independent variables.
