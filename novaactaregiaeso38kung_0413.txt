DlFFERENT1AL EQUATIONS OF THE off* ORDER. 15

Giving in either of the equations (27) suceessively two values ί
and j to the index i and eliminating the m (or m) occul-ring in these

equations , we obtain
(Γ) (Γ) (Γ) (Γ)

Di A] = DJ ,Q ........ (28),
including all the relations, which the two integrals F--O and F, 4- O
must satisfy, if independently of each other ί and j receive all integral
values from i or Αφ’ = 1 to ε’ orj Ξ n— 1.

Taking the last equ. of system (27) together with what it becomes,
if s be put for r and j for z', we get by elimination of m the forn] of the
relations, which must be satisfied by three first integrals F: O, R: O,
Fs=0 of the equation (12), viz.:

which for 3:1- reproduces (28).

The equations (28) and (29) we, therefore, may regard as complete
identities, satisfied by any two or three of the first integrals of (12).

Firstly let us have the n cquations

involving α’, y, ς and the partial differential coefficients of ε with respect
to ιυ and y up to the (ιι-1)·”“’ order, the equations (30) being not restricted
to be first integrals of a given partial differential equati0n3 we proceed to
investigate the general conditions, that must hold, in order that the values
of ,χι-Μ, epm, , ³‹·.n-1‚ obtained froin (30) may render the equa-
tions (15) integrable.

To the notations, used in the equations (26) and (27), we add the
following

where the parentheses are used to denote, that we differentiate, for instan-
ce, with respect to ατ, as far as it is involved in F or F„ both explicitly
and implicitly through ε and its partial differential coefficients of all occur-
ring orders eoecept tlze hiyhest. Lastly we also put
