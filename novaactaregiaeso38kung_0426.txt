if the equ. (44) have no equal roots and all the arbitrary functions φ be
independent of each other. That this is the very same general solution,
that would be obtained by performing the integrations according to the fore-
going general theory, is easily shewn. For here (21) and (23) are imme-
diately integrabie, as all the [uls are eonstants and give n first integrals that
will be obtained from the equation:

by putting suocessively r = 1, 2, .. ., η. Hence we get the differential
coefficients of z of the (n— ])⁵‘ order as sums of the funetions ψ multi-
plied by certain constants. Substituting these expressions in (15) and inte-
grating, we get suceessively the differential coeffieients of ε of the (n — 2)⁷²‘¹ ‚
(ns—3)''¹¹‚ . . ., ΞΜ and first order all as linear functions of such arbitrary
functions3 and, finally, substituting in d: = ³1„ dm ÷ εΗ dy and inte-
grating, s will also be expressed as a sum of oz arbim-ary distinet and in-
dependent functions. Q. E. D.

For writing the equation (44) briefly ιν’(υι) z Ο, we get, by sub-
