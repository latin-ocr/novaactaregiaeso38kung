they will, in fact, when equated to arbitrary eonstants, be integ-vals to (11),
(15) and (16). By means of these equations we have, therefore, to de-
duce a system of ordinary differential equations, to which the equations
(14), considered as simultaneous, are a solution. qi and ψ being found,
an arbitrary relation ‹p=s(1,l1) will be a first integral to (12). The system
of ordinary differential equations, from which φ and ψ are to be found,
may be deduced in the following manner. From (16) we get

Multiplying in the second member numerator and denominator by

ZJ-m, in the third member similarly by ΖΗΝ and subtraeting numerator

from numerator, denominator from denominator we get by means of (11)

and (13) dy XZ‘ — XZ l U

where we have to put suocessively i: 1, 2, , n— 1. The formula
(18) also involves (17), if we, as before, suppose μηΞΟ.

Now, supposing 22:22— 1 in (15), put sueoessively =i=o, l, 2,

by μω, po„ , μ, 1 add them, we thus get after division by dr
