When there are η distinct first inteyrals το (12), they will satiqu tlze

We suppose the equation (20) completely solved.

1) Assuming that this equation has not equal roots, if we ean inte-
grate the equations (21) and (23) for every one of these roots, we get vn
distinet first integrals, whieh give such values of the differential eoe'ffieients
of z of the (ιι-1)’“ order, as will render the equations

integi-able. These equations being integrated, we take out the values of
the differentia] eoeffieients of ε of the (n—2)ffl order and substitute in
the equations

after the integration of whieh we get expressions for the differential eoeffi-
eients of ε of the (n —— 3)st order and so ou. Groing on in this way, we
will finally get 21¹0 and 2o,1 as functions of ω, y and ε. Substituting
their expressions in the equation
