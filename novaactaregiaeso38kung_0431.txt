In ξ. 6 we have hriefly exemplified, how the foregoing theory ot
linear equations may be used also to integrate those, that are not linear.
We shall now deduce the general formulae, that are to be used for the in-
tegration of non-linear partia] differential equations of the 22²⁶ order with
oue dependent and two independent variables, and also shew, how these
formulae in special cases coincide with known auxiliary systems.
