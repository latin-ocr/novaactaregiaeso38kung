DIFFERENTIAL EQUArroNs or THE 20²¹* ORDER. 13

Denoting d—vv

for determining m the equation

by m we get, after the quantities μ have been eliminated,

,ζ (-1)1‘ Lama-1 = 0 ....... (20),

which together with the equation

(ly — mdtu = O ......... (21)
are equivalent to (17) and (18).

In order to be able to use (19), we must determine the quantities
μ from (17) and (18), or else, putting Uvas: W„ we have to determine
W the equations

W,= ΠΗ, IVe-—l— ΙΫΗ m: U (i=1‚ 2, , “n—l) . . . . (22).

(We need not necessarily use the equ. Wffl m: U„ whieh follows
from (17)). Having calculated the quantities W, the equation (19) may be
used in the form

ι ’1-1
S W, ὤση-Η,-

Now the equations (20), (21), (22) and (23) supply the place of
(17), (18) and (19); and by integrating the former group of equations, the
functions (p and ψ will be known.

Suppose m a root ot' the equation (20), we substitute this root in
(22) and get a system of quantities W. Then (21) and (23) will be two
ordinary simultaneous differentia] equations, where the eoet'fieients of the dif-
ferentials are known t'unetions of m, pf, .- and the differentia] eoet'fieients of
ε up to the (oz—lp order. Integrating these we get a system of values
of ‹s- and ψ. And 111 this manner there will be as many sueh systems, as
the equation (20) has distinct roots, supposing, of course, that the integra-
tions are always possible. If, 011 the contrary, the equation (20) has equal
roots, the number of these systems wil] be less thau 11. Α8 11011Ἰν an arhi-
trary relation between a (s and a ψ, constituting together sueh a system,
is a first integral of (12), there will be found as many first integr-‘ils of
the given partial differential equation, as the equation (20) has distinct roots,
all the integrations in (21) and (23) being supposed possible.
