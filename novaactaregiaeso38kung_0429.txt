DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS or THE Μ’ ORDER. 31

and this being integrated r times with respect to y gives

S an-ossm--r = J Efflssfflly'ss S yffi*1 ψ, (w) ,

where it is to be observed, *hats Q(y)dy is itself an arbitrary function

as well as φ,(9) and, therefore, may simply be changed into x‹(y)·

The last equation may evidently be written

the accordance in form with (48) is evident.

We 'might also have transformed (53) by putting z-w, z ε’,

Now if the general solution of the last equation be found, and we
suppose it be ε’ = QQQRZJ), we have only to seek the general solution
from the eqnation

which is immediately integrable.

Corollary V. If V Ξ Fon-v) be a rational integral polynome‚ we
may, by its differentiation with respect to 0116 01· both of the independent
variables, form a new linear differential equation with constant coe‘fficients
and with a right member either zero or of one of the forms considered in
foi-egoing corollaries. After the integration of this new equation its 30111-
tion must be so restricted, that it satisfies the given cquation. Of the new
equation we must, of course, use the yeneral solution, in order to be sure,
that the general solution of it may contain the general solution of the given
equation as a special case.

The following examples will fully illustrate this method.
