DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS or THE πω ORDER. 35

and then the equation (58) becomes ἢ
0⁶[Zdoe -Ι- ndy -ἦ- S {n-ffidzu-m] = Ο ,

because by (57) fida* = only. This case of (58) is evidently the result

β

of the total differentiation of (54). The root Z, therefore, must be rejected,

because it only reproduces the given differential equation with an arbitrary
constant instead of its right member, 03 and accordingly the solution of
(54) is to be obtained by means of the auxiliary system (57), (58) and

S(—1)¹· {NJ mvmi = o ...... (co),

from which we finally choose two systems, produced by putting alternate-

ly β Ξ O and οι Ξ O. These two systems then will belong to the two

equations between (54) and (55). These auxiliary equations may, if desi-
rable, be simplified by the equations

(ἱΞΟ,1,2, ..., ‘r and νΞ O,1,2, ..., 72—1).
This is the general method to integrate partial differential equations
of the nm order with one dependent and two independent variables, and

may, of course, be applied as well to linear as to non-linear equations.
We proceed to shew some special cases of it.

The equation (60) becomes here ζΙνο m— {M Ξ O, whence (57)
