DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS or THE 722⁶ ORDER. 29

Treating· this identity in a similar way, we get

gQfffflssssgffffl=ramffwflm-mwfflmm÷wfflwmnffw>
Η

 

 

This process we may repeat as many times, as we please, and we
see, that the exponent of that aa, which multiplies the function ψ 111 the left
member, determines the order of the highest derived function of f(m),
that occurrs.

Now, as the root m is repeated λ times in f(m.) z O, we have
f(rn) =f¹ (m) =f⁴¹ (m) z fſtr„ (1η) = O, and, therefore, the right
members in (45) and the equations, that are derived fron] it by the (λ-4 1)
first differentiations with respect to m, will all vanish. These equations‚
therefore, shew that the equation (43) will be identically satisfied by every
one of the expressions, that stand in the enunciation of the theorem.

Corollary. As we have obtained Λ distinct solutions belonging to a
root repeated λ times in (44), wc can. also here, get n. distinet solutions
and, therefore, by theoren] Π the general solution of (43), even when (44)
has equal roots. That general solution will be ε = a sum of oz terms,
presenting for every simple root 111,. a term φώρ-111111) and for every
root m, repeated λ times, a sum of ternis of the forn]

1 (y — 1111) 4 11110 — 111) 4 112 <y — 1111) 4 4 ¹ 1)-1 (11 4 111).

These theorems are, of course, valid, also when (44) has imaginary
roots, but then the solutions will involve functions of iinaginary functions.

We now proceed to set forth some corollaries to theoren] I, as far
as it applies to the equation

‘S ciffi„ = 1* = Fa, y) ...... (48),
ι’ΞΟ

shewing how to obtain a particular solution of this equation.

Corollary Ι. If I* = F(oe)‚ u may be considered as a function
of cv onlyi then the equation (48) becomes, when ε = u,

CO und, = F(1) ‚

whence it follows, that we may put

u = gosuFQr) dost

sudenoting n successive integrations with respect to x.
