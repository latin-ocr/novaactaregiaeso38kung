20 Μ. FALK, ΟΝ THE INTEGRArlon 01 PARTIAL

we obtain by its integration the yeneral solution of (12), as each of the first
integrals involved one arbitrary function.

2) If, however, the equation (20) has equal roots, then we find a
less number than n distinct first integrals. If from these integrals we
ean obtain some of ‘the differential coefficients 01 z of the (η —- 1)³l order
and after their substitution in some of the equations (40) integrate them and
so go on similarly as in the former case, the solution of (12) will be de-
pendent on the solution of another partial differentia] equation of an order
lower by one or more units than the given equation. 11 this new equation
be linear, we may anew apply the given method to integrate it, if it be
not linear, the method of the ξ. 8 01 11115 1110111011 must be used to obtain
its solution, which will in that case usually be a complete or a mixed one.

If the equation (20) cannot be completely solvcd, bnt some of its
roots are known, the same method, as in the latter ease (when (20) has
equal roots), must be applied.

Sometimes we may by artifices reduce the latter to the former case
by taking instead 01 (12) a new equation, such that its equation (20) has
no equal root, and at the same time such, that its roots become identical
with the roots of the equation (20), belonging to (12), for certain values of
some eonstants involved in the new assumed equation. In order then to ob-

tain the general solution of (12) from that of the new equation, the method
of limits is to be applied.

The equations (11), or those between (10) and (11), sliew,'tllat the
φ 31111 ψ, which belong 10 3 00113111 11151 integral, are functions only of
each other, if we consider all quantities, that they involve, except the dif-
ferential coefficients of z of the (n— 1)·‘l order, as constants3 that is 10
say: if between φ Ξ οι and ds z β we eliminate any of these differen-
tial coefficients, all the others will disappear at the same time. We may
also express that property briefiy thus: φ 31111 ψ 310 111110110115 01 0110 and
the same function of the differential co'effieients af ε 01 1110 (η- 1)³l order
31111 involve besides none of them in any other way. This diminishes the
labour of solving the equation φ ΞῙΝᾸ) with respect 10 the function in
question, which is necessary for obtaining the expressions for the differen-
tial coefficients of z of the (n—1)⁸‘ order3 it deserves, however, attention,
11131 111 general it is impossible to solve the n first integrals with respect
to these differential coefficients‚ provided these diff. eoeff. really are in-
volved boch in φ and ψ. But, in this case, we must seek the complete
primitive of (12) and may then, if the functions φ really involve 1110 diffe-
