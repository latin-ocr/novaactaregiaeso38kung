Dlrrnnenrmn EQUArioNs OF THE πώ ORDER. 17

whence, by putting successively r= 1, 2, 3, ..., (ra—1), all the desired
relations will appear. These are theu the relations, that must be identi-
cally satisfied, in order that the values of the differenti-al coefficients of z
' of the (oz—lr' order may render the equations (15) integrable.

The equations (15) take a much simpIer form, when the equations (30)
are n distinct integrals of the equation (12), that is: when they satisfy the
relations (28). In the equations (33) we may, namely, interchange the rows
01· columns in any way, because then the determinants in their left members
can not undergo any change except, perhaps, with respect to their signs.

Thus the equations (33) may be written

Now choosing an arbitrary integer i such that DQO , the relations
(34) may have their left members multiplied by Dis), that is: we may in the
determinants, represented by (34), multiply the terms in their first rows by
that quantity. The determinants in the equations, thus formed, will remain
unchanged, if from every term of their first rows we subtract the corre-
sponding ternis of their second rows multiplied by the quantity ΔΥ) . Then,
in virtue of the equations (28), all the terms in the new first rows will be
severally zero except the first, so that (34) becomes
