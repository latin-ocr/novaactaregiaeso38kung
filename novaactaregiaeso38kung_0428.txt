Corollary II. If V= Fffly), we may put v z ‘vu—r u, if 02sz

be the last term, that does not vanish in the left member of (48) and
u a filnotion of y only. Substituting in (48)7 we easily obtain

Corolloery III. If V: Far) -1- Fl(y), the general solution of (48)
will be z = u -4- v -ἱ- ζ ‚ u and v being any particular solutions of the

equations

and ζ the general solution o—t' (43). For putting z = u 4- v -1- ζ, we get
by means of (51) and (52)

S 02- ξω = ο,

which proves our assertion. According to the corollaries I and II we may,
therefore, use the u and v of (49) and (50).

C'orollary IV. If some ternis be missing at the. beginning and the
end of the left member of (48), this equation is immediately integrable
several times and will thus be reduced to a new equation of the form (48)
but of a lower order.

If, for instance, the equation (48) be

S( Q, :ww = F(a÷‚31) ...... (53) ‚-

where ν· and ρ arc integers < η and n —-- ρ > r. Integrating (53) ρ
times with respect to ιι), we get without difficulty
